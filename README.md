# Typing Speed and Accuracy Game

This project is a JavaScript application designed to measure typing speed and accuracy. Users are presented with random text prompts and are timed as they type out the text. Upon completion or interruption, the application calculates typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and provides feedback on errors made during typing.

- **Typing Speed Calculation**: Measures typing speed based on the time taken to complete the prompt.
- **Error Tracking**: Counts and displays the number of errors made during typing.
- **User Interface**: Simple user interface with start and end game functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for functionality.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic structure and styling of the user interface.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Interaction with HTML elements for dynamic content updating.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the "Start" button to begin typing the displayed prompt.
3. Type out the prompt as accurately and quickly as possible.
4. Click the "End" button to finish and view your typing speed and error count.
